###Updating an existing repositroy using  a simple shell command

  - I am making an ecommerce website and I got tired of typing in commands after a change so I made a script to do the work for me.
  - This script accepts a mesage and uploads everything in the existing directory where it was run
  - I made a cronjob to be updating  my code of the ecommerce website every 30 minutes:)
